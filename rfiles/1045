                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Generally, <span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span> are red/brown with black bands and orange yellow rings on abdomen. They have hair on thorax and less hair on abdomen. They also have a pollen basket on their hind legs. Honeybee legs are mostly dark brown/black.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">There are two castes of females, sterile workers are smaller (adults 10-15 mm long), fertile queens are larger (18-20 mm). Males, called drones, are 15-17 mm long at maturity. Though smaller, workers have longer wings than drones. Both castes of females have a stinger that is formed from modified ovipositor structures. In workers, the sting is barbed, and tears away from the body when used. In both castes, the stinger is supplied with venom from glands in the abdomen. Males have much larger eyes than females, probably to help locate flying queens during mating flights.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">There are currently 26 recognized subspecies of <span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span>, with differences based on differences in morphology and molecular characteristics. The differences among the subspecies is usually discussed in terms of their agricultural output in particular environmental conditions. Some subspecies have the ability to tolerate warmer or colder climates. Subspecies may also vary in their defensive behavior, tongue length, wingspan, and coloration. Abdominal banding patterns also differ - some darker and some with more of a mix between darker and lighter banding patterns.</p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Honeybees build a hive out of wax secretions from their bodies, and queens lay their eggs in cells in the wax. The speed of subsequent development of the young is strongly affected by temperature, and is fastest at 33-36°C.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Honeybees are holometabolous insects, and have four stages in the life cycle: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate"><em>A. mellifera</em> eggs hatch in 28-144 hours, depending on their temperature. The larva that emerges is a small white grub. It stays in its wax cell, growing, and is fed and groomed by adult workers. The food that a female larva receives determines whether it will be a queen or worker. At 34°C, larvae feed and grow for 4-5 days, queens for 6 days, and males for 6-7 days. At the end of that period their cell is sealed by adult workers, and the larva molts, spins a silk cocoon, and transforms into the pupa stage. Pupae undergo a massive metamorphosis that takes about 7-8 days for queens, 12 days for workers, and 14-15 days for males. Once their final metamorphosis is complete, they chew their way out of the cell and begin their adult life. They will not grow or molt after emerging. Adult workers will live for 2-4 weeks in the summer, or as long as 11 months if they live through the winter. Males only survive for 4-8 weeks, and do not live through the winter. Queens live 2-5 years.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">. The next stage is the larval stage where the larva is fed the royal jelly, pollen/nectar, and honey combination. Next the larva goes into the pupae stage where it caps itself into its cell to metamorphose into the mature stage.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Queens normally take 16 days to reach maturity, the worker bees take 21 days, and the drone takes 24 days to mature. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#0e1e5cd19c260fdb4d08eb961d59ee87" class="citation">Adjare, 1990</a>; <a href="#c2112f512f1891769dfacc1ae3ec74c9" class="citation">Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">The great majority of female <em>A. mellifera</em> in a hive are sterile workers. Only queens mate and lay eggs. Normally there is only a single reproductive queen in a hive.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">During periods of suitably mild weather in spring and summer, males leave the hive and gather at "drone assembly areas" near the hive. Virgin queens will fly through these areas, attracting the males with pheromones. The males pursue, and attempt to mate with the queen in flight. Sometimes a "comet" forms, as a cluster of males forms around the female, with a string of other males trying to catch up. Each male who succeeds in mating drops away, and dies within a few hours or days. Males who do not mate will continue to loiter in the assembly areas until they mate or die trying. Queens will mate with up to 10 males in a single flight.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Queens may mate with males from their own hive, or from other hives in the area. The queen's mating behavior is centered around finding the best place to mate beforehand, by taking directional flights for a period of time, lasting no more than a couple of days. Afterward, she leaves the hive and flies to mate with drones in an assembly area. This normally starts to occur after their first week of birth. The queen does this up to four times. After this congregate of mating has occurred, she never mates again in her lifetime. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#0e1e5cd19c260fdb4d08eb961d59ee87" class="citation">Adjare, 1990</a>; <a href="#c2112f512f1891769dfacc1ae3ec74c9" class="citation">Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998</a>; <a href="#2f58b99f7f9e5906974220a079cc4a7f" class="citation">Tarpy and Page Jr., 2000</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate"><span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span> queens are the primary reproducers of the nest and all of the activities of the colony are centered around their reproductive behaviors and their survival. The queen is the only fertile female in the colony. She lays eggs nearly continuously throughout the year, sometimes pausing in late fall in cold climates. A particularly fertile queen may lay as many as 1,000 eggs/day, and 200,000 eggs in her lifetime. It takes a queen about 16 days to reach adulthood, and another week or more to begin laying eggs. Males take about 24 days to emerge as adults, and begin leaving the nest for assembly areas a few days after that.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Queen honeybees can control whether or not an egg they lay is fertilized. Unfertilized eggs develop as males and are haploid (have only one set of chromosomes). Fertilized eggs are diploid (two sets of chromosomes) and develop as workers or new queens, depending on how they are fed as larvae. Queens may increase the ratio of male to female eggs they lay if they are diseased or injured, or in response to problems in the colony.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Healthy, well-fed honeybee colonies reproduce by "swarming." The workers in the colony begin by producing numerous queen larvae. Shortly before the new queens emerge, the resident, egg-laying queen leaves the hive, taking up to half the workers with her. This "swarm" forms a temporary group in a tree nearby, while workers scout for a suitable location for a new hive. Once they find one, the swarm moves into the space, and begins building comb and starting the process of food collection and reproduction again.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Meanwhile at the old hive, the new queens emerge from their cells. If the population of workers is large enough, and there are few queens emerging, then the first one or two may leave with "afterswarms" of workers. After the swarming is completed, any remaining new queens try to sting and kill each other, continuing to fight until all but one is dead. After her competition is removed, the surviving queen begins to lay eggs.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Normally the pheromones secreted by a healthy queen prevent workers from reproducing, but if a colony remains queenless for long, some workers will begin laying eggs. These eggs are unfertilized, and so develop as males. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#0e1e5cd19c260fdb4d08eb961d59ee87" class="citation">Adjare, 1990</a>; <a href="#6db7a284f90432b4c692d42812f75f0e" class="citation">Milne and Milne, 2000</a>; <a href="#c2112f512f1891769dfacc1ae3ec74c9" class="citation">Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998</a>; <a href="#2f58b99f7f9e5906974220a079cc4a7f" class="citation">Tarpy and Page Jr., 2000</a>)</span></p>

                  <h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">European honeybees are eusocial insects. They live in colonies that contain one reproductive female (the queen) and her offspring. Sterile female offspring of the queen (the workers) perform all the work of the colony and are by far the most numerous caste in the hive. Males and queens spend all their effort on reproduction, see the Reproduction sections for information on mating behavior and egg production.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate"><em>A. mellifera</em> workers show what is called "age polyethism." Their behaviors change as they get older. Newly emerged workers clean cells, preparing them for a new egg or for food storage. After a few days they shift to other hive maintenance work, removing waste and debris, fanning to maintain air circulation and temperature, processing nectar brought by foragers, and feeding the queen and larvae from glands in their head and body. In their second week of adult life workers' wax glands become active and they help build and repair the comb, while continuing to tend the queen and feed workers. <span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span> workers build a "comb", a sheet of hexagonal cells made of waxes they secrete. Each cell can house one larval bee, and cells are also used as protected storage space for honey (processed nectar) and pollen.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Between 12 and 25 days, workers take a turn guarding the hive, inspecting any bees that try to enter the hive - driving off strangers and attacking any other creatures that try to enter.  After about three weeks, the workers food and wax glands atrophy, and they shift to foraging duty.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Foraging only occurs during daylight, but bees are active in the hive continuously.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">In temperate climates, colonies store honey and pollen to feed on during the winter. During cold temperatures the workers and queen form a tight ball or cluster, working their flight muscles to generate heat and keep themselves warm. In warmer tropical regions, honeybees maintain smaller stores of food.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">If a colony's nest conditions become too poor, the entire colony may move to a new site. This is particularly common in tropical honeybees, that move in response to seasonal drought. Beekeepers call this "absconding", and work to prevent it in domesticated colonies.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Swarming is a behavior in a nest where a new queen is born that takes the place of the older one in that hive. The departing queen normally takes some of the workers with her.  Swarming bees send out worker scouts to look for a suitable home to take the place of the one they left. The swarm of bees is just temporary. They normally swarm over a twig or branch of a tree or anywhere that can be used temporarily as an intermediate nest. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#0e1e5cd19c260fdb4d08eb961d59ee87" class="citation">Adjare, 1990</a>; <a href="#c2112f512f1891769dfacc1ae3ec74c9" class="citation">Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998</a>)</span></p>

                  <h3 id="communication">Communication and Perception</h3>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate"><span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span> communication is based on chemical signals, and most of their communication and perception behaviors are centered around scent and taste. The members of the hive colony are bound chemically to each other. Each hive has a unique chemical signature that hivemates use to recognize each other and detect bees from other colonies.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Within the hive, bees are in constant chemical communication with each other. Workers feed and groom each other, as well as larvae, drones, and the queen. In the process they pass on pheromones, chemical signals that indicate information about the health of the queen and the state of the colony.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Chemicals not only help with detecting the right signature of hives but also with foraging. Honeybees use scent to locate flowers from a distance. When a successful forager returns to the hive, it passes the scent of the flowers to its nest mates, to help them find the same patch of flowers.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Bees also use chemicals to signal outside the hive. When a worker stings something, her stinger releases an alarm pheromone that causes other bees to become agitated, and helps them locate the enemy.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Thought it's always dark in the hive, vision is important to honeybees outside. They can see other animals, and recognize flowers. The eyes of <a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Apis/">Apis</a> species can detect ultraviolet light wavelengths that are beyond the visible spectrum. This allows them to locate the sun on cloudy days, and see markings on flowers that are only visible in ultraviolet light. One portion of honeybee's eyes  is sensitive to polarized light, and they use this to navigate.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Workers and queens can hear vibrations. New queens call to each other and workers when they first emerge. Workers hear the vibrations of the waggle dances made by returning foragers.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate"><a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Apis/">Apis</a> species have a particularly notable form of communication called "dancing." Foragers that have located an abundant supply of food do a dance to communicate the location of the patch to other foragers. A "round dance" indicates food within about 300 meters of the hive, and only communicates the presence of the flowers, not the direction, though workers will also get the scent from the food the forager has brought back. The more complicated "waggle dance" indicates the direction and distance of food further away, using the location of the sun and the bee's memory of the distance it flew to return to the hive. Symbolic communication is quite unusual among invertebrates, and these honeybee "dances" have been intensively studied. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#074cc3a6d5991515fef1f20b631fc7ba" class="citation">Breed, et al., 1985</a>; <a href="#6db7a284f90432b4c692d42812f75f0e" class="citation">Milne and Milne, 2000</a>; <a href="#c2593c440f8c4b327bb5b837a8a8758a" class="citation">Reinhard, et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#5ede1da6d179c4dd73587d025fac48f9" class="citation">Roat and Landim, 2008</a>; <a href="#c2112f512f1891769dfacc1ae3ec74c9" class="citation">Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998</a>; <a href="#69f0b518afa418bfea6b440d84b5253d" class="citation">Sandoz, et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#1421ef3d4efd5d24d5cd7309f5c58dda" class="citation">Sherman and Visscher, 2002</a>)</span></p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate"><span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span> feed on pollen and nectar collected from blooming flowers. They also eat honey (stored, concentrated nectar) and secretions produced by other members of their colony.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Workers forage for food (nectar and pollen) for the entire colony. They use their tongues to suck up nectar, and store it in the anterior section of the digestive tract, called the crop. They collect pollen by grooming it off the bodies and onto special structures on their hind legs called pollen baskets.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Returning foragers transfer the nectar they have collected to younger worker bees that in turn feed other members of the hive, or process it into honey for long-term storage. They add enzymes to the honey, and store it in open cells where the water can evaporate, concentrating the sugars.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Young workers eat pollen and nectar, and secrete food materials, called “royal jelly” and “worker jelly”, from glands in their heads. This material is fed to young larvae, and the amount and type they get determines if they will be queens or workers.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Honeybees forage during daylight hours, but are equally active on cloudy or sunny days. They will not fly in heavy rain or high winds, or if the temperature is too extreme (workers can't fly when they get below 10°C). During the warm, calm weather the honeybees collect the most pollen even if it is cloudy. If the light intensity changes rapidly, they immediately stop working and return to the hive. If it lightly rains, pollen collection stops, because moisture inhibits the bee’s ability to collect it. However, nectar collection is not inhibited by light rain. Wind also affects the rate of pollen collection.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Honeybee workers are opportunistic. They will steal from other hives if they can. Hive-robbing can be dangerous, but a weakened or damaged hive may be raided by workers from other hives, especially when nectar flows in flowers are not abundant. Honeybees will also collect “honeydew,” the sweet fluid excreted by sap-feeding insects like <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Aphididae/">aphids</a>. <span class="citations"> (<a href="#0e1e5cd19c260fdb4d08eb961d59ee87" class="citation">Adjare, 1990</a>; <a href="#c260af301a4a01e2e6342d668b0e7a1c" class="citation">Gonzalez, et al., 1995</a>; <a href="#694219f1a30f8c36e191ec25a55eea61" class="citation">Percival, 1947</a>; <a href="#c2112f512f1891769dfacc1ae3ec74c9" class="citation">Sammataro and Avitabile, 1998</a>)</span></p>

                  <h3 id="predation">Predation</h3>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Honeybees have many adaptations for defense:
Adults have orange and black striping that acts as warning coloration. Predators can learn to associate that pattern with a painful sting, and avoid them.
Honeybees prefer to build their hives in protected cavities (small caves or tree hollows). They seal small openings with a mix of wax and resins called propolis, leaving only one small opening.
Worker bees guard the entrance of the hive. They are able to recognize members of their colony by scent, and will attack any non-members that try to enter the hive. 
Workers and queens have a venomous sting at the end of the abdomen. Unlike queens, and unusual among stinging insects, the stings of <a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Apis/">Apis</a> workers are heavily barbed and the sting and venom glands tear out of the abdomen, remaining embedded in the target. This causes the death of the worker, but may also cause a more painful sting, and discourage the predator from attacking other bees or the hive.
A stinging worker releases an alarm pheromone which causes other workers to become agitated and more likely to sting, and signals the location of the first sting.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Honeybees are subject to many types of predators, some attacking the bees themselves, others consuming the wax and stored food in the hive. Some predators are specialists on bees, including honeybees.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Important invertebrate enemies of adult bees include <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Thomisidae/">crab spiders</a> and <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Araneidae/">orb-weaver spiders</a>, wasps in the genus <a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Philanthus/">Philanthus</a> (called “beewolves”), and many species of social wasps in the family <a class="taxon-link rank-family" href="/accounts/Vespidae/">Vespidae</a>. Vespid wasp colonies are known to attack honeybee colonies en masse, and can wipe out a hive in one attack. Many vertebrate insectivores also eat adult honeybees. Toads (<a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Bufo/">Bufo</a>) that can reach the entrance of hive will sit and eat many workers, as will opossums (<a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Didelphis/">Didelphis</a>). Birds are an important threat – the <a class="taxon-link rank-family" href="/accounts/Meropidae/">Meropidae</a> (bee-eaters) in particular in Africa and southern Europe, but also flycatchers around the world (<span class="taxon-name">Tyrranidae</span> and <a class="taxon-link rank-family" href="/accounts/Muscicapidae/">Muscicapidae</a>). <span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span> in Africa are also subject to attack by <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Indicatoridae/">honeyguides</a>. These birds eat hive comb, consuming bees, wax, and stored honey. At least one species, the greater honeyguide (<a class="taxon-link rank-species" href="/accounts/Indicator_indicator/">Indicator indicator</a>) will guide mammal hive predators to hives, and then feed on the hive after the mammal has opened it up.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">The main vertebrate predators of hives are mammals. <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Ursidae/">Bears</a> frequently attack the nests of social bees and wasps, as do many <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Mustelidae/">mustelids</a> such as the <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Eira_barbara/">tayra</a> in the Neotropics and especially the <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Mellivora_capensis/">honey badger</a> of Africa and southern and western Asia. In the Western Hemisphere <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Mephitidae/">skunks</a>, <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Cingulata/">armadillos</a> and <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Vermilingua/">anteaters</a> also raid hives, as do pangolins (<a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Manis/">Manis</a>) in Africa. Large primates, including <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Papio/">baboons</a>, <span class="interpreted">chimpanzees (&lt;&lt;g.Pan&gt;&gt;)</span> and <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Gorilla/">gorillas</a> are reported to attack hives too. Smaller mammals such as mice (<a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Mus/">Mus</a>) and rats (<a class="taxon-link rank-genus" href="/accounts/Rattus/">Rattus</a>) will burrow into hives as well.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Some insects are predators in hives as well, including wax moth larvae (<a class="taxon-link rank-species" href="/accounts/Galleria_mellonella/">Galleria mellonella</a>, <a class="taxon-link rank-species" href="/accounts/Achroia_grisella/">Achroia grisella</a>), and hive beetles (<span rank="Genus" class="taxon-name rank-genus">Hylostoma</span>, <span rank="Genus" class="taxon-name rank-genus">Aethina</span>), and some species of <a class="taxon-link" href="/accounts/Formicidae/">ants</a>. In their native regions these tend not to be important enemies, but where honeybees have not co-evolved with these insects and have no defense, they can do great harm to hives.</p>

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Honeybees are very important pollinators, and are the primary pollinator for many plants. Without honeybees, these plants have greatly reduced fertility. In North America and Australia, where there are no native bee species with large colonies, honeybees can have especially strong effects on native flowers, and on other pollinators such as solitary bee species. Honeybees ability to recruit fellow workers by “dancing” allows them to be more efficient than other pollinators at exploiting patches of flowers. This can create strong impacts on their competitors, especially solitary bees.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Like all social insects, honeybees are hosts to a variety of parasites, commensal organisms, and pathogenic microbes. Some of these can be serious problems for apiculture, and have been studied intensively. At least 18 types of viruses have been found to cause disease in bees, including Sacbrood disease. Several of them (but not sacbrood virus) are associated with parasitic mites. Bacteria infect bees, notably <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">Bacillus larvae</span>, agent of American Foulbrood disease, and <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">Melissococcus pluton</span>, agent of European Foulbrood. Fungi grow in bee hives, and <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">Ascosphaera apis</span> can cause Chalkbrood disease. One of the most common diseases in domesticated hives is Nosema disease, caused by a protozoan, <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">Nosema apis</span>. An amoeba, <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">Malphigamoeba mellificae</span>, also causes disease in honeybees.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">In recent decades, two mite species have spread through domesticated and feral honeybee populations around the world. <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">Acarapis woodi</span> is a small mite species that lives in the tracheae of adult bees and feeds on bee hemolymph. It was first discovered in Europe, but its origin is unknown. Infestations of these mites weaken bees, and in cold climates, whole colonies may fail when the bees are confined in the hive during the winter. A much worse threat is <a class="taxon-link rank-species" href="/accounts/Varroa_destructor/">Varroa destructor</a>. This might evolved on an Asian honeybee, <a class="taxon-link rank-species" href="/accounts/Apis_cerana/">Apis cerana</a>, but switched on to <span rank="Species" class="taxon-link rank-species">Apis mellifera</span> colonies that were set up in east Asia. It has since spread all around the world, except Australia. Juvenile mites feed on bee larvae and pupae, and adult female mites feed and disperse on adult workers. This mite is known to spread several viruses as well. Infestations of <em>V. destructor</em> often wipe out colonies. Nearly all the feral, untended honeybee colonies in North American are believed to have been wiped out by mite infestations, along with a large proportion of domesticated colonies. Other mite species are known from honeybee colonies, but they are not considered harmful.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Another commensal or parasitic species is <a class="taxon-link rank-species" href="/accounts/Braula_coeca/">Braula coeca</a>, the bee louse. Despite the common name, this is actually a wingless fly, that apparently feeds by intercepting food being transferred from one bee to another.</p>
                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">Beetles in the genera <span rank="Genus" class="taxon-name rank-genus">Hylostoma</span> and <span rank="Genus" class="taxon-name rank-genus">Aethina</span> are found in African honeybee nests, where they seem to do little harm. However, the "small hive beetle", <span rank="Species" class="taxon-name rank-species">Aethina tumida</span>, has become a significant problem in European and North American hives.

                  <p audience="advanced intermediate">While the species as a whole is still very numerous, there is concern in Europe that widespread commercialization of beekeeping is endangering locally-adapted populations and subspecies. This, combined with higher mortality of colonies due to Varroa mite and tracheal mite infestations, and the recent phenomenon of Colony Collapse Disorder in North America, has cause significant concern for the health of the population. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) is a condition of commercial beehives, where there are sudden massive waves of mortality among the workers. Beekeepers discover their hives simply empty of workers, with so few surviving that they cannot tend the queen and brood. This condition has occurred mainly in North America, and mainly in large commercial apiaries.

                        <p>in deserts low (less than 30 cm per year) and unpredictable rainfall results in landscapes dominated by plants and animals adapted to aridity.  Vegetation is typically sparse, though spectacular blooms may occur following rain.  Deserts can be cold or warm and daily temperates typically fluctuate.  In dune areas vegetation is also sparse and conditions are dry.  This is because sand does not hold water well so little is available to plants.  In dunes near seas and oceans this is compounded by the influence of salt in the air and soil.  Salt limits the ability of plants to take up water through their roots.</p>
