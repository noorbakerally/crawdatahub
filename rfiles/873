Is there anything like that planned?  In some ways Linked Data is an 
engineering experiment and benefits from that freedom to experiment. 
On the other hand interoperability eventually needs clear specifications.

Unsure, but I'll also ask the question, is there anything planned? I'd 
certainly +1 standardization and do anything I could to help the process 
along.

or perhaps an IG/XG follow up to the SWEO, taking in to account Read 
Write Web of Data, hopefully with a some protocol or best practice 
report giving a migration path to standardization?

There are certainly plenty of other groups to take in to account and 
consider in all of this, like the WebID XG.

Best,

Nathan
