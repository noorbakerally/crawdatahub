Welcome to the <a href="http://thedatahub.org/dataset/linked-structured-product-labels">Linked Structured Product Labels (LinkedSPLs) resource</a>. LinkedSPLs publishes all sections of FDA-approved drug package inserts from <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/about.cfm">DailyMed</a> for use by NLP and Semantic Web researchers. This resource is part of the "Addressing PDDI Evidence Gaps" project funded by that National Library of Medicine (1R01LM011838-01). </p>

<p>View the most recent LinkedSPLs presentations on slideshare:
<ul>
<li><a target="new" href="http://www.slideshare.net/boycer/linked-dataandsp-lsfdaspljamboree092014">LinkedSPLs overview - dynamic enhancement of product labeling proof-of-concept</a></li>
<li><a target="new" href="http://www.slideshare.net/boycer/pharmacogenomics-annotation-in-drug-product-labeling">Extending SPLs with clinical pharmacogenomics annotations</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Currently, data from the product labels of all United States prescription drugs and a subset of over the counter medications is provided. A powerful feature of LinkedSPLs is that all active moieties and product labels are mapped to PURLs from standard terminologies, many of which are available in <a href="http://bio2rdf.org/">bio2rdf</a>. The resource contains manually validated mappings between drug product active ingredients and DrugBank, ChEBI, NDF-RT, DRON, and FDA/NDF-RT Established Pharmacologic Classes. The resource includes an index of product label sections noted as having pharmacogenomics information by the  <a href="http://goo.gl/llrC4">FDA Pharmacogenetic Biomarker Table</a>. <!-- Also, this site's SPL data is updated weekly and all SPLs retain <a href="http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/about.cfm">DailyMed</a> versioning data so that researchers can record the provenance of the text and sections they work with. --> LinkedSPLs is provided as a service as part of the <a href="https://www.dikb.org/">Drug Interaction Knowledge Base (DIKB) project</a>.

	<h2>3. Updates and Known Issues  </h2>
	<p> (01/30/17) <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The LinkedSPLs resource has recently updated. Please see the <a href="https://github.com/bio2rdf/bio2rdf-scripts/tree/release3/linkedSPLs">code repository</a> for details of mappings and <a href="http://forums.dikb.org/t/linkedspls-is-updated-at-01-18-2017/85">forum</a> for related issues and discussions.  
	</p> 
	<!-- <p> (3/21/14) <b>IMPORTANT:</b> This resource has been updated to be current with SPLs in DailyMed as of February 15 2014. All resource mappings were updated except pharmacogenomics and DrugBank. We expect to have these done by April 10th 2014. Due to an internal issue that will soon be fixed, this version of the dataset does not provide mappings from FDA UNII and RxNorm to NDF-RT. Please contact us if you need a complete update sooner. -->
	<!-- <p> (02/21/13) The update script is currently broken and so SPLs are current only to December of 2012. Please see the <a href="https://dbmi-icode-01.dbmi.pitt.edu/dikb-evidence/update_lodd_dailymed.log">a log of several recent updates</a> for a list of SPLs that are updated in DailyMed but not in this resource as of February/March of 2013. This issue will be fixed in Apri (join our project to help make this fix more quickly!). -->
	<!-- <p> (9/27/13) NDF-RT chemical ingredients are now mapped to SPL active moieties and provided within the context of SPL resources. Thanks to Dr. Qian Zhu and her colleagues at Mayo for contributing this mapping! See <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23256517">PMID 23256517</a> for more details on the mapping.  -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	<!-- <p>(9/1/13) The base url of the <a href="https://dbmi-icode-01.dbmi.pitt.edu/dikb-evidence/linkedSPLs-dump.nt.bz2">LInkedSPLs RDF dump</a> is now the same as that provided by this D2R server so that the URIs in the graph will resolve to HTML pages is browsed. -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	<!-- <p> (8/26/13) SPLs in LinkedSPLs has been completely reinitialized using data from August 17th downloaded from DailyMed. The drug class mappings were also updated. -->
	<!-- </p>	 -->
	<!-- <p> (8/26/13) The <a href="http://goo.gl/llrC4">FDA Pharmacogenetic Biomarker Table</a> is the June 19th 2012 version. Please note that the mappings were not created for ADO-TRASTUZUMAB EMTANSINE, CRIZOTINIB, DROSPIRENONE AND ETHINYL ESTRADIOL, IVACAFTOR, MYCOPHENOLIC ACID, PERTUZUMAB, SODIUM PHENYLACETATE AND SODIUM BENZOATE, VALPROIC ACID, and the combination "RIFAMPIN, ISONIAZID, AND PYRAZINAMIDE" -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	<!-- <p> (8/31/12) This D2R Server version of the linkedSPLs dataset is provided so that users can browse example portions of the dataset. Performance is currently very slow and query results are limited to 100 items. The entire RDF graph is available for download (see above) and installation in your local triple store. Also, there is a publically accessible high performance mirror of the full dataset (with bonus data!). Please contact Richard Boyce at rdb20 -at- pitt -dot- edu for more information. -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	<!-- <p> (8/31/12) Note that when importing the <a href="http://goo.gl/llrC4">FDA Pharmacogenetic Biomarker Table</a> we mapped the "Metabolic and Endocrinology" therapeutic application to ncbit:Endocrinology, "Dermatology and Dental" to ncbit:Dermatology, and "Reproductive and Urologic" to ncbit:Urology. -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	<!-- <p> (8/09/12) An updated import of the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/StructuredProductLabeling/ucm162549.htm">FDA Established Pharmacologic Class (EPC) classes</a> was created. At present, there are over 34K mappings between drug products and EPC classes (many products have multiple ingredients from different classes), over 5K mappings from product to Chemical/Ingredient class, and over 7K mappings from product to a mechanism of action. -->
	<!-- </p> -->
	<!-- <p> (6/30/12) All SPLs for drug products should be mapped to RxNORM PURLs using the dc:subject property. All active moieties should be mapped to RxNORM ingredients using the dailymed:activeMoietyRxCUI property. Similarly, an attempt is made to map all active moieties to ChEBI (OBO) and DrugBank (drugbank.ca) using dailymed:subjectXref.  There are also mappings to DrugBank and bio2rdf by the dailymed:subjectXref property. These are known to be incomplete at this time. The list of active moieties that have not been mapped to DrugBank in bio2rdf is here: <a href="https://dbmi-icode-01.dbmi.pitt.edu/dikb-evidence/active-moieties-not-mapped-to-DrugBank-and-bio2rdf.log">active-moieties-not-mapped-to-DrugBank-and-bio2rdf.log</a>  -->
